## Course Description

In this course you'll learn all about using linear classifiers, specifically logistic regression and support vector machines, with scikit-learn. Once you've learned how to apply these methods, you'll dive into the ideas behind them and find out what really makes them tick. At the end of this course you'll know how to train, test, and tune these linear classifiers in Python. You'll also have a conceptual foundation for understanding many other machine learning algorithms.

## 1 - Applying logistic regression and SVM
In this chapter you will learn the basics of applying logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs) to classification problems. You'll use the scikit-learn library to fit classification models to real data.

## 2 - Loss functions
In this chapter you will discover the conceptual framework behind logistic regression and SVMs. This will let you delve deeper into the inner workings of these models.

## 3 - Logistic regression
In this chapter you will delve into the details of logistic regression. You'll learn all about regularization and how to interpret model output.

## 4 - Support Vector Machines
In this chapter you will learn all about the details of support vector machines. You'll learn about tuning hyperparameters for these models and using kernels to fit non-linear decision boundaries.
