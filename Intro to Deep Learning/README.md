## Course Description

Use TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for structured data.

---

## [1 - A Single Neuron](/Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/1-a-single-neuron.ipynb)
Learn about linear units, the building blocks of deep learning.

## [2 - Deep Neural Networks](/Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/2-deep-neural-networks.ipynb)
Add hidden layers to your network to uncover complex relationships.

## [3 - Stochastic Gradient Descent](/Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/3-stochastic-gradient-descent.ipynb)
Use Keras and Tensorflow to train your first neural network.

## [4 - Overfitting and Underfitting](/Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/4-overfitting-and-underfitting.ipynb)
Improve performance with extra capacity or early stopping.

## [5 - Dropout and Batch Normalization](/Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/5-dropout-and-batch-normalization.ipynb)
Add these special layers to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.

## [6 - Binary Classification](/Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/6-binary-classification.ipynb)
Apply deep learning to another common task.
