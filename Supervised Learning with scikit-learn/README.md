## Course Description

Grow your machine learning skills with scikit-learn and discover how to use this popular Python library to train models using labeled data. In this course, you'll learn how to make powerful predictions, such as whether a customer is will churn from your business, whether an individual has diabetes, and even how to tell classify the genre of a song. Using real-world datasets, you'll find out how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data.

## [1 - Classification](/Supervised%20Learning%20with%20scikit-learn/1%20-%20Classification/)

In this chapter, you'll be introduced to classification problems and learn how to solve them using supervised learning techniques. You'll learn how to split data into training and test sets, fit a model, make predictions, and evaluate accuracy. Youâ€™ll discover the relationship between model complexity and performance, applying what you learn to a churn dataset, where you will classify the churn status of a telecom company's customers.

## [2 - Regression](/Supervised%20Learning%20with%20scikit-learn/2%20-%20Regression/)

In this chapter, you will be introduced to regression, and build models to predict sales values using a dataset on advertising expenditure. You will learn about the mechanics of linear regression and common performance metrics such as R-squared and root mean squared error. You will perform k-fold cross-validation, and apply regularization to regression models to reduce the risk of overfitting. 

## [3 - Fine-Tuning Your Model](/Supervised%20Learning%20with%20scikit-learn/3%20-%20Fine-Tuning%20Your%20Model/)

Having trained models, now you will learn how to evaluate them. In this chapter, you will be introduced to several metrics along with a visualization technique for analyzing classification model performance using scikit-learn. You will also learn how to optimize classification and regression models through the use of hyperparameter tuning.

## [4 - Preprocessing and Pipelines](/Supervised%20Learning%20with%20scikit-learn/4%20-%20Preprocessing%20and%20Pipelines/)

Learn how to impute missing values, convert categorical data to numeric values, scale data, evaluate multiple supervised learning models simultaneously, and build pipelines to streamline your workflow!
