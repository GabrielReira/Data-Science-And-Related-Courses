## [1 - Introduction](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/1-introduction.ipynb)
Review what you need for this course.

## [2 - Missing Values](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/2-missing-values.ipynb)
Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.

## [3 - Categorical Variables](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/3-categorical-variables.ipynb)
There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning.

## [4 - Pipelines](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/4-pipelines.ipynb)
A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing.

## [5 - Cross-Validation](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/5-cross-validation.ipynb)
A better way to test your models.

## [6 - XGBoost](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/6-xgboost.ipynb)
The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.

## [7 - Data Leakage](/Intermediate%20Machine%20Learning/7-data-leakage.ipynb)
Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.
