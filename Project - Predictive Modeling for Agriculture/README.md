# Predictive Modeling for Agriculture

This project is part of the [Machine Learning Fundamentals with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/machine-learning-fundamentals-with-python) track, provided by DataCamp.

## Project Description

Dive into agriculture using supervised machine learning and feature selection to aid farmers in crop cultivation and solve real-world problems.

A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures:

- Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- Potassium content ratio in the soil
- pH value of the soil

The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?
