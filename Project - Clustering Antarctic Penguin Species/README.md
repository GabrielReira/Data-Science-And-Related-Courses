# Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

This project is part of the [Machine Learning Fundamentals with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/machine-learning-fundamentals-with-python) track, provided by DataCamp.

## Project Description

Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering.

Unsupervised learning is a critical task in machine learning, and it plays a significant role in this project. The objective is to delve into the information about penguins by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques on a thoughtfully curated dataset. By conducting thorough data exploration, extracting meaningful features, and employing advanced algorithms, this project aims to uncover concealed patterns, clusters, and relationships that exist within the dataset.
